# National Tests Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to map all Norwegian elementary schools to compare their performance with the national average in national tests. Using data from the [Directorate of Education](https://www.udir.no/tall-og-forskning/statistikk/statistikk-grunnskole/nasjonale-prover-5.-trinn/), this project provides insights into school performance in an interactive and visual manner.

## Color Coding of Schools
- **Green schools** - Performances better than average
- **Red schools** - Performances below average
- **Blue schools** - The top-performing schools in each county

## Important Note
Some schools are not included in the dataset and are therefore not represented in this analysis.

## Visualizations
The visualizations below illustrate the different categories of school performances, based on their color coding.
